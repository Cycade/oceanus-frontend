Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) is a critically endangered possum largely restricted to small pockets of alpine ash, mountain ash, and snow gum forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia, north-east of Melbourne. On 2 March 1971, the State of Victoria made the Leadbeater's possum its faunal emblem. To protect Leadbeater's possum in Victoria, this project is built by OceanWorld Team.
